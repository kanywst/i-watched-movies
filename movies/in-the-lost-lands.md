A man named Boyce directly addresses the viewer, warning them that what they're about to see is not a happy fairytale. Earth has become an uncivilized, dystopian wasteland called the Lost Lands. In a society ruled by Overlord, order is forcibly maintained by the Church. Gray Alys, a witch, is being hanged, on the orders of The Enforcer and her followers from the Church. Gray Alys uses her powers to trick a man into helping her escape, but The Enforcer kills him for it and leads a group of men in pursuit of Alys.
