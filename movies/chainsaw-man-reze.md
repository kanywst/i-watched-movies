Denji, a boy who transforms into Chainsaw Man through a contract with the “Chainsaw Devil,” fights demons as a Devil Hunter belonging to Public Security's Anti-Demon Special Division 4. While giddy over a date with Makima, his admired superior at Public Security, he encounters a sudden rain shower and takes shelter, where he meets a girl named Reze. Reze, who works at a nearby cafe, smiles gently at Denji, and the two quickly grow close. This encounter marks the beginning of a major shift in Denji's everyday life.
