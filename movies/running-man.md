In the near future, the United States is ruled by the Network, an authoritarian media network. Most viewers live in poverty with little access to healthcare, and the Network placates the masses with trashy, violent game shows and reality television. The most popular program is The Running Man, hosted by Bobby Thompson, in which "runners" can win $1 billion by surviving 30 days while being hunted down by the Network's five hunters, led by the mysterious Evan McCone, as well as ordinary citizens. Given $1,000 and a 12-hour head start, runners are required to film themselves every day, or else forfeit their earnings but still be hunted.
