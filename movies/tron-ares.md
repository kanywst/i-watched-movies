In 2025, ENCOM and Dillinger Systems are in a race to bring digital constructs into reality. Dillinger Systems is led by Julian Dillinger, former ENCOM executive Ed Dillinger's grandson, and ENCOM is led by Eve Kim. Eve and her partner Seth Flores visit a remote station near Skagway, Alaska set up by Kevin Flynn decades ago, believing his computers hold the "permanence code" to break the 29-minute barrier holding back the constructs. After finding the code, they transfer a digital orange tree into the real world, where it lasts indefinitely, even failing to freeze in the frigid weather.
