Kabir, the legendary spy who once betrayed his nation and disappeared, had now transformed into India's greatest threat. No longer capable of being stopped, the government dispatches India's elite military unit Vikram as the decisive countermeasure. Having lost everything to a certain event, Vikram is driven solely by his mission to eliminate Kabir. But as the fight progresses, it gradually evolves from a mere mission to a personal quest for revenge against Kabir himself.
