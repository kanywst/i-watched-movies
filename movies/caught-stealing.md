In 1998, Henry "Hank" Thompson is a bartender living on the Lower East Side. He calls his mother in Patterson, California, every day, especially to discuss their shared love of the San Francisco Giants. Hank is haunted by a drunken car crash that killed his friend and ended his major league baseball ambitions and left him with a dependency on alcohol.
