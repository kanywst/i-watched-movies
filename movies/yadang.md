Lee Kang-soo profits by providing drug intel to the prosecution, while his partner, ambitious prosecutor Goo Gwan-hee, gains career success from these arrests. Kang-soo was a young man who supported his mother while working as a designated driver. His life changes when he is tricked by a customer into consuming a drug-laced drink and unjustly jailed. Goo recognizes his sharp memory and recruits him to befriend the imprisoned head of a drug trafficking ring, and successfully gathers intelligence on the organization through him. Their partnership flourishes, and Kang-soo becomes a yadang (an informant or undercover operative), while Goo rises through the prosecutorial ranks.
